In this project I learned...

* How to use a dialog box - showing it and closing it.
* How to add a method to a constructor's prototype.
* Gathering and using data from user input through event listeners.
* Using indexOf in conjuction with removeChild to both delete a card from the visual page and the internal array.
* Additionally, I learned the value of deleting all of my code and starting from scratch again to ensure that I am truly understanding every part of the assignment.
