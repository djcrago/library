This is a summary of all I learned in the project.

* I learned how to make use of a dialog box - This was probably the most interesting and useful part of this project for me.
* I practiced using :hover
* I practiced using object constructors
* I learned how to use data from forms - This was also a really important learning point for me.
* I learned how to create elements using user input
* I practiced reorganizing my code in a way that made sense to me
* I learned one method of dynamically adding elements to a page from an array - Each time I wanted to add a new element I added it to the array, cleared the page of elements, then added everything from the array to the page.
* I did some side testing around prototypal inheritance (that didn't get used)
